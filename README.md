To add new items to the to-do list, a user can type into the bar at the top of the screen and once done typing, can click anywhere else in the window.

This click will send the new to-do list item to the database for storage. Upon a page refresh, the newly added item will be visible along with its completion status. 

Done items will feature a light blue filled in circle in the top right corner of each to-do list item.

Not-done items will feature the same circle, but with no light blue coloring. 

Sometimes, the user will have to click a filled in circle twice to get it to revert back to the "not-done" status. This is a bug that arose late in the process and I was not able to address before submitting.

To delete an item, the user can click the trash icon in the lower right hand corner of each to-do list item. This will require a page fresh to be visible, but upon clicking, the item will be removed from the database.

Filtering can be done using the radio buttons and associated button found below the text entry box. 

Choosing any of the selections will display all to-do list items that fall under that category.
